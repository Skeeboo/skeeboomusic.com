After exploring the blues scale with [Geronimo](/music/geronimo), I decided to give another try at this exciting combination of tones. This time, instead of a straight rhythm, I opted for a swing rhythm and a gentler athmosphere. 

An upright bass gives the rhythm to the tune, together with a drum kit played with brushes. The melody is shared between a hammond organ and a RMI Electra electric piano.
