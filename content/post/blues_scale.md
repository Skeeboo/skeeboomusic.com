There are several "blues scales" in music, but maybe the best known is made by taking a [minor pentatonic scale](/post/pentatonics) and adding one [blue note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_note) between the third and fourth note.

Here's how a minor pentatonic sounds like:

And here the "blue note" is added, giving us the six-note blues scale:

## Straight rock

At my ears, when played in a straight rhythm like in the previous example, the blues scale recalls straightforward energy and power; in a word, rock! 

That's how, after some nights of improvisations, the blues scale turned into a melody:

Played by a hammond organ and backed by a classic rock rhythm that theme became [Geronimo](/music/geronimo).

## Swinging the blues

If you play the same scale with a swing rhythm, you get something like this:

The swing rhythm gives, according to my taste, a more graceful, sexy and charming mood to the same scale. I tried to convey this feeling with this short theme:

I gave the theme to an old Electra Piano, added an organ, an upright bass and a drum kit played with brushes, and [Marilyn](/music/marilyn) was born:

That's how the tracks number 3 and 4 of my ["Moods and Modes"](/#music) project were made. I'd really love to know [what you think about it](/#contact).
