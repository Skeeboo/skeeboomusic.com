As you may know, I am writing a collection of short instrumental sketches inspired by the feelings I get from different musical scales.

 The project is called ["Moods and Modes"](/post/moods_and_modes) and it's summarized in [another page of this website](/post/moods_and_modes).

 After exploring [pentatonic scales](/post/pentatonics), the [blues scale](/post/blues_scale) and the [pentascales](/post/pentascales), I turned my attention to the "humble" C major scale.

## C major scale

That is, in its simplicity, the scale we all learn as kids:

At my ears it calls for simple and serene melodies. I decided to explore it from different point of views: that of the mind and that of the body

## The mind

The C major scales can be the stuff of dreams, at least the serene and simple ones. This is the melody I came up with (here played on the piano, with chords):

I thought the perfect dress for this simple dream should be completely acoustic, with piano, strings and flute. That's how [Simple Dreams](/music/simple_dreams) came to be:

## The body

The C major scale is the perfect one to dance to (with a smile on your face). Hear this simple melody based on the descending C major scale:

Cheating a little beat as before, I added some notes (A-B-C) also on the upper octave:

The character of this scale is more sombre and reflective. The melody I came up with is this:

I imagined played in a smokey bar with a latin jazz feel. With an old piano and a muted trumpet to set the mood, this ended up in [Autumn Sunset](/music/autumn_sunset)

That's how the tracks number 5 and 6 of my [Moods and Modes](/post/moods_and_modes) project were made. I'd really love to know [what you think about it](/#contact).
