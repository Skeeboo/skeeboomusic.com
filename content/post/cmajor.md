As you may know, I am writing a collection of short instrumental sketches inspired by the feelings I get from different musical scales.

 The project is called ["Moods and Modes"](/post/moods_and_modes) and it's summarized in [another page of this website](/post/moods_and_modes).

 After exploring [pentatonic scales](/post/pentatonics), the [blues scale](/post/blues_scale) and the [pentascales](/post/pentascales), I turned my attention to the "humble" C major scale.

## C major scale

That is, in its simplicity, the scale we all learn as kids:

{{<google_drive track="15xhgVMECRZWb7WU3tc_z5SXJP8bojJ8s">}}

This scale is seldom used in music composition but... why not? To have more material to work with, I cheated a little bit and permitted myself to move the hand, playing some of the 5 notes (C-D-E-F-G) also on the lower or upper octave. This is the extended scale:

This is a short melody composed with this material:

This melody sounded to me as festive and somewhat strange, so I imagined a bunch of aliens saluting the rising sun on their planet, I gave the melody to an alien-sounding synth sound, and [Sunrise on Mars](/music/sunrise_on_mars) was born.

## Minor pentascale

If you put your right thumb on an A key instead, and let your other fingers lay down on successive white keys, you get a minor pentascale (A-B-C-D-E):

Cheating a little beat as before, I added some notes (A-B-C) also on the upper octave:

{{<google_drive track="1yQ79Zf8atB5H9xogq0HJtHSCf3Z0g2N9">}}

The character of this scale is more sombre and reflective. The melody I came up with is this:

{{<google_drive track="15sRByNLRvzrdVdKWmq8U1RXBTVVnaslF">}}

I imagined played in a smokey bar with a latin jazz feel. With an old piano and a muted trumpet to set the mood, this ended up in [Autumn Sunset](/music/autumn_sunset)

That's how the tracks number 5 and 6 of my [Moods and Modes](/post/moods_and_modes) project were made. I'd really love to know [what you think about it](/#contact).
