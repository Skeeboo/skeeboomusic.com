As you may know, I am writing a collection of short instrumental sketches inspired by the feelings I get from different musical scales.

 The project is called ["Moods and Modes"](/post/moods_and_modes) and it's summarized in [another page of this website](/post/moods_and_modes).

 After exploring [pentatonic scales](/post/pentatonics), the [blues scale](/post/blues_scale) and the [pentascales](/post/pentascales), I turned my attention to the "humble" C major scale.

## C major scale

That is, in its simplicity, the scale we all learn as kids:

At my ears it calls for simple and serene melodies. I decided to explore it from different point of views: that of the mind and that of the body

## The mind

The C major scales can be the stuff of dreams, at least the serene and simple ones. This is the melody I came up with (here played on the piano, with chords):

{{<google_drive track="1Rjf_DiIHTQOBNXid3MjGKirTJeqijGpA">}}

I thought the perfect dress for this simple dream should be completely acoustic, with piano, strings and flute. That's how [Simple Dreams](/music/simple_dreams) came to be:

## The body

The C major scale is the perfect one to dance to (with a smile on your face). Hear this simple melody based on the descending C major scale:

A caribbean mood, a flute and a trumpet playing a game of "call and response" transformed this little melody in [Serenidad](/music/serenidad):

## The joke

Now let's try a little joke by spicing the C major scale with a "blue note". This idea came from the always inspiring method of improvisation "Create First" by [Forrest Kinney](https://forrestkinney.com). If you add a lowered third you get this mischievious 8-note scale:

Here's a melody I wrote with this hybrid scale, continuously drifting between a major and a minor mood:

{{<google_drive track="19qpPX5s9WSWlW4YEpR0z4V0icuj2nSBP">}}

I gave the melody to a fiddle (to be honest, I imagined it played by a violin from the start) with the accompaniment of a small "speakeasy" jazz band. The result is "Easy Goin'":

{{<bandcamp_small title="Easy Goin'" track="3013165940" link="https://skeeboo.bandcamp.com/track/easy-goin">}}

That's how the tracks number 7,8 and 9 of my [Moods and Modes](/post/moods_and_modes) project were made. I'd really love to know [what you think about it](/#contact).
