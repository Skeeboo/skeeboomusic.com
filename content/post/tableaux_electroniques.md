"Tableaux Électroniques" is a new musical project born in 2020; its purpose is to offer my take on the "remix culture".

Every piece in the project:

* is based on themes taken from 2 pieces of the [Moods and Modes](/post/moods_and_modes) project. The themes are recorded anew, so they are citations more than remixes (no audio sample is taken from the original).
* has melodies and background harmonies generally played by acoustic instruments, but their sound is treated by audio effects in a subtle or not so subtle way.
* has a rhythmic backbone of electronic drums and bass.

Credits for the inspiration of this project goes to the fine folks at the [Electronic Music Alliance](https://1emalliance.weebly.com/) that showed me how the meeting and melting of the electronic and acoustic worlds can benefit and enrich both of them. And they remixed a bunch of my tracks too! :)

As always, the best way to keep you up to date on the project is to leave your email address in the form below; this will start a monthly conversation between us! </br>

Here's a super handy table that will keep track of all the pieces composed for the project and links with a link to a webpage for every piece (where you can read a little background on its composition) and a music player to hear it right away. Enjoy!
