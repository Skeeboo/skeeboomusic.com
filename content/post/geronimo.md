Let me introduce to you my new friend [Geronimo](/music/geronimo), a rock track based on the blues scale.
Short and straight to the point, it features a hammond organ solo with a classic rock rhythm accompaniment.

[Let me know](/#contact) what you think about it!

As usual you can download it at [bandcamp](http://skeeboo.bandcamp.com/track/geronimo), streaming it at [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/3Iqq1ETVvcaN6pfvfGQJsw), or get it at your preferred music store. Enjoy!
