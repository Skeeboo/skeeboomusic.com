"Moods and Modes" is my current main musical project; its purpose is to explore the feelings that the different musical scales and modes inspire (to me) by composing a collection of short instrumental tracks. The pieces are inspired  by the wonderful improvisation method devised by the late [Forrest Kinney](https://forrestkinney.com).

The best way to keep you up to date on the project is to leave your email address in the form below and I will send you a monthly update with some insight and background on every new song: </br>
{{<mail_form>}}

I have also collected all the pieces in a single Spotify playlist which you can save to your library if you like: </br>
{{<spotify_player uri="spotify:user:5hoyhgo5r9ff4dstwdukednrf:playlist:6urzWct3U1z8b1SRWtBHUX">}}

The pieces are collected in volumes of six songs each; every one can be downloaded [at my Bandcamp site](https://skeeboo.bandcamp.com).

Here's a super handy table with a link to a webpage for every piece (where you can read a little background on its composition) and a music player to hear it right away. Enjoy!
