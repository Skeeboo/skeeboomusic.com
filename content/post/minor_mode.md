As you may know, I am writing a collection of short instrumental sketches inspired by the feelings I get from different musical scales.

 The project is called ["Moods and Modes"](/post/moods_and_modes) and it's summarized in [another page of this website](/post/moods_and_modes).

 After exploring [pentatonic scales](/post/pentatonics), the [blues scale](/post/blues_scale), the [pentascales](/post/pentascales), and the [C major scale](/post/cmajor) I wrote three pieces inspired by the sonorities of the minor scale

## Natural minor scale

The minor scale (Aeolian mode) is a scale generally associated with feelings of sadness and seriousness. Judge by yourself:

Improvising over a simple chord progression I came up with this simple piano melody:

{{<google_drive track="1MzjFEv0ioEig5M8RmNMm2iZ7qcHpN4QN">}}

I took the chord progression from an improvisation exercise by [Forrest Kinney](https://forrestkinney.com) aptly named "Glimmer of hope". I kept this name for my whole piece, since the image of a troubled journey filled with obstacles overcome by grappling to determination and hope was well suited to the melody.

For the first time, I tried my hand with an orchestral arrangement for this piece. That's the final version of "[A Glimmer of Hope](/music/a_glimmer_of_hope)":

## Harmonic minor scale

The harmonic minor scale (Aeolian #7 mode) is a scale born out of harmonic needs, as a base for chords (you can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Harmonic_minor_scale)).

Used as a scale, it has a distinct "cliché" middle eastern sound:

Imprivising with this cliché mood in mind, I came up with this theme:

{{<google_drive track="1mHwzxfH1yTsay1y48MECXZRrxNcyhXva">}}

With an arrangement of Oud, Zither, middle eastern percussions and flute, that became the piece named Scheherazade:

## Mixed Mode

More often than not, the minor scales are used together, forming a melodic and harmonic palette united by a common "minor mood".

Here is a theme I wrote based on such "mixed" minor scale:

I don't know why, but the melody reminded me of the atmospheres of the soundtrack of '70s horror movies, so I tried a retro synth rock arrangement for "The Sound of Past Moments":

{{<bandcamp_small title="Sound of Past Moments" track="1405956091" link="https://skeeboo.bandcamp.com/track/sound-of-past-moments">}}

That's how the tracks number 10, 11 and 12 of my [Moods and Modes](/post/moods_and_modes) project were made. I'd really love to know [what you think about it](/#contact). 
They, together with 3 pieces on the [major scale](/post/cmajor) are collected in the [Moods and Modes vol. II EP](/music/moods_and_modes_vol2), available on [Bandcamp](https://skeeboo.bandcamp.com/album/moods-and-modes-vol-2)
