As you may know, I am writing a collection of short instrumental sketches inspired by the feelings I get from different musical scales.

 The project is called ["Moods and Modes"](/post/moods_and_modes) and it's summarized in [another page of this website](/post/moods_and_modes).

 After exploring [pentatonic scales](/post/pentatonics), the [blues scale](/post/blues_scale), the [pentascales](/post/pentascales), and the [C major scale](/post/cmajor) I wrote three pieces inspired by the sonorities of the minor scale

## Natural minor scale

The minor scale (Aeolian mode) is a scale generally associated with feelings of sadness and seriousness. Judge by yourself:

Improvising over a simple chord progression I came up with this simple piano melody:

{{<google_drive track="1MzjFEv0ioEig5M8RmNMm2iZ7qcHpN4QN">}}

I took the chord progression from an improvisation exercise by [Forrest Kinney](https://forrestkinney.com) aptly named "Glimmer of hope". I kept this name for my whole piece, since the image of a troubled journey filled with obstacles overcome by grappling to determination and hope was well suited to the melody.

For the first time, I tried my hand with an orchestral arrangement for this piece. That's the final version of "[A Glimmer of Hope](/music/a_glimmer_of_hope)":

## Harmonic minor scale

The harmonic minor scale (Aeolian #7 mode) is a scale born out of harmonic needs, as a base for chords (you can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Harmonic_minor_scale)).

Used as a scale, it has a distinct "cliché" middle eastern sound:

Imprivising with this cliché mood in mind, I came up with this theme:

{{<google_drive track="1mHwzxfH1yTsay1y48MECXZRrxNcyhXva">}}

With an arrangement of Oud, Zither, middle eastern percussions and flute, that became the piece named Scheherazade:

## The joke

Now let's try a little joke by spicing the C major scale with a "blue note". This idea came from the always inspiring method of improvisation "Create First" by [Forrest Kinney](https://forrestkinney.com). If you add a lowered third you get this mischievious 8-note scale:

{{<google_drive track="1xGkk9YmtI_t3ozN-oEeE_WgkSeH4sDoH">}}

Here's a melody I wrote with this hybrid scale, continuously drifting between a major and a minor mood:

{{<google_drive track="19qpPX5s9WSWlW4YEpR0z4V0icuj2nSBP">}}

I gave the melody to a fiddle (to be honest, I imagined it played by a violin from the start) with the accompaniment of a small "speakeasy" jazz band. The result is "Easy Goin'":

{{<bandcamp_small title="Easy Goin'" track="3013165940" link="https://skeeboo.bandcamp.com/track/easy-goin">}}

That's how the tracks number 7,8 and 9 of my [Moods and Modes](/post/moods_and_modes) project were made. I'd really love to know [what you think about it](/#contact).
