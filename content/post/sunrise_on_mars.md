+++

After exploring the [pentatonic scales](/post/pentatonics) and the [blues scale](/post/blues_scale), this track explores the major pentascale (the first five notes of a major scale). 

It's not a scale very used in music, but it's something every five-fingered classical-trained beginner pianist learn to play at the start of their career.

It's a festive and alien salute to the sun, with an interlude of strings and English Horn. I enjoyed composing an recording it, I hope you will enjoy listening to it.

If you like the track, you can download it from [bandcamp](https://skeeboo.bandcamp.com/track/sunrise-on-mars) or streaming it from [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/1vYbVFGjdrMNsbsGXTXoo1) and in [several other stores too](/music/sunrise_on_mars).
