As you may know, I am writing a small instrumental sketch for every musical scale that inspires me, exploring its mood. The project is called ["Moods and Modes"](/post/moods_and_modes) and you can learn more about it [clicking here](/post/moods_and_modes).

Today I am gonna talk about pentascales. "Pentascale" is a seldom used musical term used to describe a 5-note scale made up of the first five notes of a major or minor scales (e.g. C-D-E-F-G).

Its usefulness lies in the practice of piano teaching: every (five fingered) piano student has learned to play simple melodies based on the notes you can play without moving your hand on the keyboard: one finger - one note.

## Major pentascale

Put your right thumb on a C on the piano, and your other fingers will naturally position themselves in the successives white keys of D-E-F-G. This is the simple major pentascale:

This scale is seldom used in music composition but... why not? To have more material to work with, I cheated a little bit and permitted myself to move the hand, playing some of the 5 notes (C-D-E-F-G) also on the lower or upper octave. This is the extended scale:

This is a short melody composed with this material:

This melody sounded to me as festive and somewhat strange, so I imagined a bunch of aliens saluting the rising sun on their planet, I gave the melody to an alien-sounding synth sound, and [Sunrise on Mars](/music/sunrise_on_mars) was born.

## Minor pentascale

If you put your right thumb on an A key instead, and let your other fingers lay down on successive white keys, you get a minor pentascale (A-B-C-D-E):

Cheating a little beat as before, I added some notes (A-B-C) also on the upper octave:

The character of this scale is more sombre and reflective. The melody I came up with is this:

I imagined played in a smokey bar with a latin jazz feel. With an old piano and a muted trumpet to set the mood, this ended up in [Autumn Sunset](/music/autumn_sunset)

That's how the tracks number 5 and 6 of my [Moods and Modes](/post/moods_and_modes) project were made. I'd really love to know [what you think about it](/#contact).
