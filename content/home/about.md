# Welcome!

I am an italian amateur composer and arranger. 

My current project is "Moods and Modes": a collection of short instrumental tracks exploring different musical scales and modes. Have a look at the [music section](#music) of the website to find out more!

All the tracks are heavily influenced by the inspiring improvisation method of [Forrest Kinney](https://forrestkinney.com)
