# Welcome!

I am an italian composer and arranger. 

My main current project is ["Moods and Modes"](/post/moods_and_modes): a collection of short instrumental tracks exploring different musical scales and modes. Have a look at the [music section](#music) of the website to find out more!

All the tracks are heavily influenced by the inspiring improvisation method of the late [Forrest Kinney](https://forrestkinney.com)
