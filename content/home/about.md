# Welcome!

I am a composer and arranger from Italy.

After a 25 years hiatus, I went back making music in 2018 during a period of recovery, when I started a project called ["Moods and Modes"](/post/moods_and_modes): an ongoing collection of short instrumental tracks each one exploring a different musical scales or mode and a different mood or genre.</br>
You can read all about it [on the project page](/post/moods_and_modes). One of the latest outcomes of the project is an EP fancifully called ["Moods and Modes vol. III"](/music/moods_and_modes_vol3).

["Tableaux Ã‰lectroniques"](/post/tableaux_electroniques) is the ombrella name for all the remixes, re-compositions and combinations of "Moods and Modes" sketches made by musician friends or by myself. </br>
Trying to merge the acoustic and electronic worlds, the project is taking shape in 2020 and it has now [a dedicated page](/post/tableaux_electroniques) on the website.

You can download all my music from [Bandcamp](https://skeeboo.bandcamp.com) (at the price you want, also for free) or in the main digital stores. You can also stream it on Spotify or on your preferred streaming platform.

Have a look around and, if you like what you hear, you can leave your email in the form below and you'll receive a monthly update on new compositions, or you can follow me (much appreciated) on Bandcamp or Spotify using the buttons below.
