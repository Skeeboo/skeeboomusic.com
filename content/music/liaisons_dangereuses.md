"Liaisons Dangereuses" is track number 17 of the ["Moods and modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes). 

It's a soft waltz ballad for strings and piano with drums and double bass. The central section is a swing piano improvisation. It's the tale of a strange attraction between musical genres. 

This is my first exploration of the Lydian scale. The mood is positive and forward looking, and I hope you'll find some peace and a smile in it.
