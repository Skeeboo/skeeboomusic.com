"Clouds on the Road" is track number 14 of the ["Moods and modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes). 

It's a minimalist piece for piano and strings inspired by a trip on a road under fast moving clouds. 
The melody is in Dorian mode, a versatile scale I used also in [Fanfare for a Jester](/music/fanfare_for_a_jester). I find it serious but less melancholic than minor mode, and I plan to create at least another track (in another mood) with it before moving to a different one. Enjoy!
