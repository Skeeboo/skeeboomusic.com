"Serendipity" marks the reprise of the ["Moods and modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes) after a quite long pause. And fittingly it's a song about the happy surprises life throws at you when you're busy running the rat race.
I's a rock song with a bit of '70s nostalgia, and an unnecessarily busy hammond organ.
The cover art is my first attempt at AI generated digital art, I find it disturbingly fitting to the song theme and aesthetic. Expect more of this in the future...

This is piece no. 30 of the project (wow!) and it explores the combination of a G major and F lydian scale in a fast tempo.

Out for your streaming pleasure on Dec 29th
