"Changes" is about those subtle movements that may alter your feelings and perceptions. 
An ostinato motif on the viola changes its meaning thanks to the efforts of a flute over an electronic background.

This is composition number 22 of the ["Moods and modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes). 
It explores the realms of the B Locrian mode but, thanks to the changes in the electronic drone, the piano arpeggio and the flute melody, the piece ends in a more serene C major.

Special thanks and love goes to everyone involved in the recording:

Viola - Valentina Borgato <br/>
Flute - Mattia Pecoraro <br/>
Piano - Francesco Schibuola

Recording Engineer - Massimiliano Salvan
