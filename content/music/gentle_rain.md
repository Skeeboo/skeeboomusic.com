"Gentle Rain" is track number 16 of the ["Moods and modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes). 

It's a gentle ballad for clarinet, flute and bassoon with a backing of strings, synths and percussions. 

This is my 4th and last exploration of the Dorian scale. The mood is soft, relaxed and a little ambiguous, just like when a gentle rain soften all the sounds outside...
