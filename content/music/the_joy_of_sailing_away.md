"The Joy of Sailing Away" is the first act of the suite opening the [Tableaux Électroniques](/music/tableaux_electroniques) album.</br>
Start on this downtempo journey with the company of a flute, a violin, and some raucous beats. 

The melodic themes are derived from previous [Moods and Modes](/post/moods_and_modes) pieces: the flute theme comes from [Sail Away](/music/sail_away) while the happy violin middle theme comes from [For the Joy](/music/for_the_joy). Follow the links to hear the original versions.
