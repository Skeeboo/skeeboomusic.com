## Releases March, 5th

{{<bandcamp title="Synesthesia" track="180243059" link="https://skeeboo.bandcamp.com/track/synesthesia">}}

"Synesthesia" is a little placid dance for strings and piano inspired by the sound of colors.
A viola, a violin, a cello and a piano and some subtle electronics paint a pastel dance in a calm soundscape.

This is piece no. 28 of the ["Moods and modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes) and it explores the G major scale in a minimalist classic style.
