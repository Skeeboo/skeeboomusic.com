"Sound of Past Moments" is track number 12 of the ["Moods and modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes). 

It's a nostalgic retro rock instrumental sketch dominated by keyboards (an analog synth, a mellotron with flute tape, a piano).
The melodies are based on a "hybrid" minor scale, that merges natural minor and harmonic minor flavours.
