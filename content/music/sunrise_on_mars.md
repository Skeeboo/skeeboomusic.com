"Sunrise on Mars" is track number 5 of the ["Moods and modes" project](/music). 

It's a festive and alien salute to the sun, with an interlude of strings and English Horn.

The melody played by the synth is based on a "major pentascale" (the first five notes of a major scale). It's not a scale very used in music, but it's something every five-fingered classical-trained beginner pianist learn to play at the start of their career.  

Hear the alien choir sing!
