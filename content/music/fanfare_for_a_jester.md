"Fanfare for a Jester" is track number 13 of the ["Moods and modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes). 

It's a renaissance inspired piece where a trumpet fanfare introduces a recorder playing jester, above an accompaniment of lute and percussions. 
The trumpet fanfares and the melodies played by the recorder are based on the Dorian mode, a suggestive scale that may recall a dignified medieval court
