Sometimes you just have to let it go. A carefree swing track like "Don't Worry" may be just what you need then. 
A trumpet (with and without mute) takes it easy together with a clarinet over the accompaniment of a piano trio.

This 23rd composition of the ["Moods and modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes) explores the C major blues scale. At my ears it's the scale of the serene acceptance and embrace of life, with its peaks and valleys.
