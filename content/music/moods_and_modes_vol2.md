This [Bandcamp exclusive EP](https://skeeboo.bandcamp.com/album/moods-and-modes-vol-2) collects tracks no. 7-12 of the ["Moods and Modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes). 

The 6 short instrumental pieces explore the moods suggested by the traditional [major](/post/cmajor) and minor (natural, harmonic and mixed) scales. 

Enjoy this fast ride through psych rock, easy listening and latin jazz, classical orchestral music and some oriental flair.
