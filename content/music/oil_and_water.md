## Releasing in May

"Oil and Water" is the first piece of my new Tableaux Électronique project.</br>
This track is marked by some stark contrasts: between acoustic and electronic instruments, between fast and slow sections, between swing and straight rhythms.</br>
These contrasts won't blend, but they will come to a sort of uneasy cohabitation, just like oil and water sometimes do.

"Oil and Water" emulsify two themes taken from previous [Moods and Modes](/post/moods_and_modes) pieces: [Marilyn](/music/marilyn) for the slow section and [Geronimo](/music/geronimo) for the fast one. Follow the links to hear the original versions.

## Available starting May, 1st

Feel free to click on the cover below and pre-save the piece on Spotify!
