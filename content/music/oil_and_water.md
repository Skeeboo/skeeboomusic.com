{{<bandcamp title="Oil and Water" track="388375096" link="https://skeeboo.bandcamp.com/track/oil-and-water">}}

"Oil and Water" is the first piece of my new [Tableaux Électronique](/post/tableaux_electroniques) project.</br>
This track is marked by some stark contrasts: between acoustic and electronic instruments, between fast and slow sections, between swing and straight rhythms.</br>
These contrasts won't blend, but they will come to a sort of uneasy cohabitation, just like oil and water sometimes do.

"Oil and Water" emulsify two themes taken from previous [Moods and Modes](/post/moods_and_modes) pieces: [Marilyn](/music/marilyn) for the slow section and [Geronimo](/music/geronimo) for the fast one. Follow the links to hear the original versions.
