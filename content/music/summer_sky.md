"Summer Sky" is track number 18 of the ["Moods and modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes).

It's an ambient track inspired by the stillness of the summer sky. Piano, guitar and a music box contribute to the atmosphere.  

The melodies are based on the Lydian scale and its overwordly serene mood.

## Remix

The track has also been remixed by [Letters from Mouse](https://lettersfrommouse.bandcamp.com) using found sound percussions.
The remixed version is available as a hidden bonus track exclusively on the Bandcamp version of ["Moods and Modes vol. III"](https://skeeboo.bandcamp.com/album/moods-and-modes-vol-iii) EP.
