This [third EP](https://skeeboo.bandcamp.com/album/moods-and-modes-vol-iii) collects tracks no. 13-18 of the ["Moods and Modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes). The cover art is a great shoot by talented photographer Annie Spratt. The EP is available as a digital download on Bandcamp and on every major outlet.

The 6 instrumental pieces explore the moods suggested by the D Dorian and F Lydian modes. 

Enjoy this gallery of jazz, ambient, minimalist music and a bit of renaissance mood!
