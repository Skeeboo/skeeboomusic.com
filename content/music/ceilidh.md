"Ceilidh" is track number 21 of the ["Moods and modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes). 

The track is a celtic Jig that starts as a folk tune lead by a tin whistle and ends as a symphonic piece shepherd by a masterfully played violin.   

The melody swings between the G Mixolydian (the merry phrase) and D Dorian modes (the somber one).

This piece will be available on Jan 7th 2020; if you want to be notified just click on the cover below!
