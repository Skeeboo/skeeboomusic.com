{{<bandcamp title="Easy Goin'" track="3013165940" link="https://skeeboo.bandcamp.com/track/easy-goin">}}

"Easy Goin'" is track number 9 of the ["Moods and modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes). 

It's a happy swing tune where a fiddle strolls around a small jazz band.
The melody is based on the C major scale, but with an added [blue note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_note) (a lowered third). With this addition, the happy major scale gets a mischievous tone...
