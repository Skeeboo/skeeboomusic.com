"Kurai Umi" (Dark Waters) is track number 20 of the ["Moods and modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes). 

The piece is a trip to a "Japan of the mind" (since sadly I've never been there), suggested by a Shakuhachi flute, a Koto and a Taiko drum.  

The melody is in the Insen pentatonic scale, somewhat similar to the E Phrygian mode.

If you want to be alerted when the track will be online, click on the cover below and follow the instructions. See you in a couple of weeks!

## Upcoming release on Dec, 6th
