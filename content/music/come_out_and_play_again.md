"Come Out and Play Again" is an instrumental rock ballad that I wrote to remind me the importance of simple feelings in complicated times. <br/>
A trumpet and a tenor saxophone have a playful chat over a strings and rhythm section, with a piano offering an ostinato background.

This is the 25th composition overall of the ["Moods and modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes) and the first to tackle the G major scale. The facet of this scale here explored is its simple playful character.

## To be released on Oct, 16th
