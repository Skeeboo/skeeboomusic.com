{{<bandcamp title="Autumn Sunset" track="1497396" link="https://skeeboo.bandcamp.com/track/autumn-sunset">}}

"Sunrise on Mars" is track number 5 of the ["Moods and modes" project](/music). 

It's a cool latin jazz track, with a muted trumpet, an old piano and a clean guitar.
The melody is based on a "minor pentascale" (the first five notes of a natural minor scale).  

Hope you will like some cool season sound!
