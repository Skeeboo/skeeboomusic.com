This fourth act of the [Moods and Modes project](/post/moods_and_modes) was born during the lockdown, when traveling and exploring could happen only inside your mind.

The first three pieces are an imaginary escape through Spain, Scotland and Japan; while the last three are a journey inside our souls, between the need to change, the desire to chill and relax, the rebellion against our fears.

With this volume IV, Moods and Modes is not a solo project anymore, thanks to the musicians and friends that enriched this recording with the gift of their skills and some shards of their souls, something I will forever be grateful for.

The 6 instrumental pieces complete the journey through the modes of the C major scale, visiting E Phrygian, G Mixolydian, B Locrian, C major blues, A mixed minor.
