"Tableaux Electroniques", a [Bandcamp](https://skeeboo.bandcamp.com/album/tableaux-electroniques) exclusive, brings together electronic downtempo beats with my usual instrumental compositions. 

The album is a collection of remixes produced both by myself and by electronic producer friends, inspired by the 2018 EP ["Moods and Modes vol. I"](/music/moods_and_modes_vol1), also included on the album starting from track no. 9. This offers a fresh take on the first six acoustic pieces made for the [Moods and Modes project](/post/moods_and_modes). "Moods and Modes" short pieces were always intended to be used as source material for extensions, recombinations and contaminations. You can see this as the first experiment in that direction.

The first three songs form a sort of suite in three acts, each one made by recombining two songs from the original EP with downtempo electronic beats. 

Following up, some new perspectives on the original pieces are presented thanks to remixes by Bufinjer, ØLSKXX, Trip Jacker, Cylotron and myself.

Closing the album, the [full original EP]/post/moods_and_modes_vol1) is featured entirely.
