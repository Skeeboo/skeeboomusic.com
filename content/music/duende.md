## New live version releases on July, 3rd

{{<bandcamp title="Duende" track="894631048" link="https://skeeboo.bandcamp.com/track/duende">}}

"Duende" is track number 19 of the ["Moods and modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes).

It's a passional piece with a wink to some flamenco and habanera rhythms where a solo violin leads the way.
The melody is in E Phrygian mode, with a "spanish tinge".

A new and much improved recording will be released as the leading single of my upcoming EP [Moods and Modes vol. IV](/music/moods_and_modes_vol4), with a breathtaking solo violin part played by Valentina Borgato.
