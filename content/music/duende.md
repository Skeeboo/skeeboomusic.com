"Duende" is track number 19 of the ["Moods and modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes).

It's a passional piece with a wink to some flamenco and habanera rhythms where a breathtaking solo violin part played by Valentina Borgato leads the way.
The melody is in E Phrygian mode, with a "spanish tinge".
