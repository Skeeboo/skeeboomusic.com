One way to face your troubles is to assert your will and fight back. "No More Fears" is a small rock anthem in that vein. <br/>
Confronted by a cocky horns section, the lead flute becomes progressively more assertive, supported by a dense arrangement featuring a string section, piano, hammond organ, drums and percussions. 

This 24th composition of the ["Moods and modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes) explores the A minor blues scale. The blues scale can be mournful, but I wanted to prove it can be assertive too.

If you think this piece sounds good, it's thanks to these artful musicians and friends: <br/>
Mattia Pecoraro - Flute <br/>
Valentina Borgato - 1st and 2nd Violin, Viola

Massimiliano Salvan - Recording Engineer
