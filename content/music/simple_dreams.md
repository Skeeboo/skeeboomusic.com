"Simple Dreams" is track number 7 of the ["Moods and modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes). 

It's a simple emotional song, featuring a string section, a piano (for the forst time in the project) and a flute. 
The melody is based on the C major scale, trying to reflect its simple beauty. 

Sometimes we need just simple things.
