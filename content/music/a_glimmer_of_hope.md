"A Glimmer of Hope" is track number 10 of the ["Moods and modes" project](/post/moods_and_modes). 

It's a melancholic but hopeful composition for orchestra.
The melody is based on the A minor scale, that inspired a passionate theme which called for an orchestral treatment (the first of the project).

You can pre-save the track on Spotify by clicking on the cover art below, and be reminded on release day.
